								<h5>Miloš Milosavljević</h5>
								<p>UNITY DEVELOPER / GAME DESIGNER</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>I'm Miloš, call me Majlo(Milow), my friends call me a legend, but usually ironically. I'm a person who lives and breathes everything to do with computers, I take pride in my work, enjoy overcoming difficult challenges and learning new technologies constantly. I call my philosophy that of a dragon slayer, I face the difficult challenge with pride and enthusiasm, while using any setbacks as a chance to prove how well I can pick myself off the ground.</p>
						<p>In my personal life, my interests are varied. I'm a huge fantasy nerd and have read most of Brandon Sanderson's library and have spent too many hours engaging with anything related to D&D, but I also enjoy long distance running and have a history in martial arts. I love watching anime and engaging with "indie" content of all sorts, and also discussing psychology and philosophy over craft beers.</p>
						<p>If you're representing a company or just a fellow nerd, send me a message, I love meeting new people above all else!

						<h3 class="about__title">Experience</h3>
						<p>I did lots of work over the years, from personal to professional to freelance, I'll highlight the most important three here.</p>
						<div class="experience__item">
							<h4>Lobian Games</h4>
							<p>This is me. Any projects under this name have been either made solely by me or in collaboration with friends. I'm always cooking up something in the background, main thing being Friends 0, in development since 2022. I'm also currently working on a VR spell slinging project and a turn based game featuring Twitch integration.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="experience__item">
							<h4>Metameet</h4>
							<p>I started my professional career at Metameet, there I worked with some amazing people and I learned the value of working in a team. The main applications were a virtual space renting application for businesses, and a Metaverse world. My contributions include a minimap system, a level builder, camera controllers, syncing data over network, and lots more. Later we were transferred to different projects, where I was the main Unity Developer for Universal Tutor, a UI focused learning application for kids, which included lots of networking work.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="experience__item">
							<h4>Blue Gravity</h4>
							<p>I did freelance work for Blue Gravity for about six month, working mainly on a Clicker game called Lost Ark with a medium sized international team. The team was great and I learned a lot from everyones different perspectives, as we started this project basically from scratch, my coworker and I had lots of freedom designing systems from the ground up.</p>

					<div class="skills__text">
						<h3 class="about__title">Skills</h3>
						<p>I generally dislike this slider approach for showcasing skills, but they look pretty, so I'll use them to highlight my most important skills.</p>
						<div class="single-progress-item">
							<h6>Game Development</h6>
							<div class="progress-bar-style" data-progress="95"></div>
							<p>My main focus in game development has been with the Unity game engine, I've played around with Godot as well. I started using Unity at the beginning of 2019, my main focus has been Top Down Action games of different kinds, but I've also worked on VR games, UI focused applications and more.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="single-progress-item">
							<h6>Game Design</h6>
							<div class="progress-bar-style" data-progress="75"></div>
							<p>I've played video games my whole life, lately my focus has been on indie games developed by small teams. As a solo developer for many projects I've had to learn all parts of the game development process, and planning and documenting a game's design has always been my favorite part. I've also run several D&D campaigns in the past.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="single-progress-item">
							<h6>General Computer Knowledge</h6>
							<div class="progress-bar-style" data-progress="80"></div>
							<p>My parents bought me my first laptop as a child, and as a child did I broke it a lot, and as we were poor I had to learn to fix it a lot. Ever since, I've spent hours figuring out how to do something in the digital world, be it trying out different Linux distros, setting up servers for video games or building a PC from scratch.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="single-progress-item">
							<h6>Working In a Team</h6>
							<div class="progress-bar-style" data-progress="90"></div>
							<p>I often work alone on projects, but nothing surpasses seeing the lego piece of your work come together into a greater whole, impossible to achieve by an individual, the sense of camaraderie found when working together with peers who rely on you and you on them. Since calling yourself a team player is cliche, consider me a fellow collaborator.</p>
